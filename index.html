                    <p>My name's Anthony. Nice to virtually meet you! I was born in Ohio but currently live in WI. I
                        currently
                        work as a Site Leader at an Amazon Sort Center. I'm interesting in switching career paths,
                        moving from
                        Operations Management to Software Development at Amazon. I love spending time with my family and
                        anything to do with the outdoors or anything I can do with my hands! Many of my hobbies are
                        pictured to
                        the right!</p>

                    <p>I love the great state of Ohio! It's where I was born and home of The Ohio State Buckeyes! Ohio
                        was
                        granted statehood in 1803 and now has 88 counties. I love the state flag as it is most closely
                        aligned
                        with the US Flag (in my opinion at least!). Fun fact about Ohio - Ohio is the leading producer
                        of
                        greenhouse and nursery plants.</p>

                <p>I love spending time with my family! I have 5 kids and my wife and I will be celebrating 19 years of
                    marriage this year! I also really enjoy hunting and fishing as well as woodworking!</p>
