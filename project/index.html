            <h2>About MSP8</h2>
            <p>MSP8 is a North America Amazon Sort Center located in Woodbury, MN. It launched in August of 2022 as a Last
                Mile Sort Center. It's a little over 500,000 square feet in size and has the ability to process more than
                300,000 Amazon packages per day!</p>

            <h2>What does MSP8 do?</h2>
            <p>As a Last Mile Sort Center (LMSC), it distributes customer packages primarily to the
                United States Postal Service network, which serves as the end-point delivery service provider for MSP8's
                geographic
                customer scope (hence the "Last Mile" nomenclature). While MSP8 is considered to be a LMSC, in Amazon's
                larger supply chain network, it fits within the Middle
                Mile scope as part of Amazon's transportation network. We use innovative technology to provide the very best
                service for our customers!</p>
